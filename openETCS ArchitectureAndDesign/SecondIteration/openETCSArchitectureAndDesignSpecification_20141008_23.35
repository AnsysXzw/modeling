\section{Functions ERTMS/ETCS}

\subsection{introduction}

The ERTMS / ETCS system was developed with a view to interoperability of trains on the 
different European rail networks. It is divided into "tracks" - and "board" finishes 
and shall establish a mutual message operation, by beacons or through a "radio" - 
The transmission system (in this case a mobile telephone network GSM-R) is performed. 
It defines several operating levels, and the system must also interfaces with the 
existing monitoring systems of the trains (using STM) have. 
The ERTMS / ETCS system provides the transport operator (the track) the choice of conditions 
concerning the use and operation. 
The train must therefore may go with different operating conditions on routes. 
Thus has the onboard equipment but must be implemented, 
to the interoperability of the train to ensure on the other networks. 
These functions must therefore correspond to one standard: the SRS (version x.x.x). 

application functions, which have two different species of origin: 
defined in the SRS: here one finds in particular the 
speed monitoring- and transfer functions; these functions 
must be implemented in full accordance with the SRS; they can in 
indeed be on any network on which the train is used; these functions 
are described below in Section x.x.x; 


Moreover, there are functions to adapt to the train: so, for example, the processing 
a "separation distance" in the airborne equipment trigger: 
This is dependent on the distribution of functions between the 
Control monitoring equipment (which the ERTMS / ETCS), and the other 
CCS Systems.

Exception of Wegmessungsmoduls (this manages its own exchange protocols.
The summary of telepowering telegrams of the BTM module in a complete Eurobalise message a balise group with the same ID, with review of the 
Balisentelegramheader, management of the duplicated beacons and detecting the direction. 
In addition, the receipt of a Referenzbalise from the linked type, in addition to the 
Balise group, reported for the computational comparison of path measure modul. \\

 \subsection{F2 Elaboration track messages}
 
 \textbf{See Figure 2 - Block F 2}\\
 
  Inputs:\\
``will be complete''\\

 Outputs:\\
 ``will be complete''\\
 
 Description: This function module provides the encoding and decoding of track messages that 
Management of the port and power off RBC, and the management of reference 
Beacons, which are based on the track messages.\\

 \subsubsection{	F21: Receive Eurobalise Messages} 
 \textbf{SRS:} § 3.4, § 3.6, § 3.16, § 3.17, § 4.8\\
 
  \textbf{Inputs:}\\
``will be complete''\\

 \textbf{Outputs:}\\
 ``will be complete''\\
 
 \textbf{Description:} 
 This function module provides the summary of telepowering information and the 
review of coherence the content of telepowering message. 
This module separates the eurobalise message as follows: 
 
 - The Balise telegram heads for checking the consistency of the different 
Telegrams, the management of the duplicated beacons and the acquisition of meaning. \\

- Then the information that the balise group, their reading direction and are 
Wegmessungsposition where the first balise group was read, in 
Baliseninformationen for monitoring the function "Manage the eurobalises" 
summarized (see the term Identifzierung and meaning in this function), which the 
Continuation of reading via the information Referenzbalise with a Balisenposition in 
Kernel-reference document approved. \\

\textbf{- The ETCS ETCS version and packages:} \\

The first review is the version ETCS ETCS track with the version Zugbord 
(Version 1.x Class1 =) to compare; these must be compatible (that means 1.y) to 
continue processing (a Balise version of the type is 0.y as incompatible 
considered, but they must not generate a negative reception report). \\

The second review is in compliance with the ETCS grammar in the resulting 
Packets with a packet 255, which terminates the beacon information of each of the group. \\

The reception of a packet 245 (standard package) in a eurobalise) includes the 
Rejection of all other packets received and generated a the same mistake as 
Grammatical errors ETCS, unless the OBU is in Level 2. \\

Only the packets 44, 65, 66 and 136 may be located several times in a same eurobalise message\\ 
For the 136 package: \\
• a single packet 136 per Balise telegram, \\
• the different packages 136 in a same message are identical. \\

The read packets are filtered as a function: \\

- from the direction of the transition to the balise group (the packet is the variable 
QDIR oriented), 
the bi-default state (level, level of announced and ERTMS / ETCS mode). \\

The tables of filtering per level and ERTMS / ETCS mode are in the description of the 
Function "received EUR radio messages" contain.\\

\textbf{These packets are transmitted in four different groups:}

- Geographical information (packet 79 for the "train locations") \\

- Information CNX / DCNX (packets 42, 131) for the "the CNX and DCNX 
Euro Radio Management "\\

- Information Balise (package 136: Referenzbalise for in-fill information) for the function 
"Manage eurobalises" \\

- Track-mail received (other packages) for the "monitor train". \\

\textbf{Any error of Referenzbalise, the version or the grammar ETCS is in CR (radio channel) 
Receiving reported.}\\
 
 
 \subsubsection{F22: Receive Euroradio Messages}
  \textbf{SRS} § 3.4, § 3.6, § 3.16, § 4.8\\
  
    \textbf{Inputs:}\\
``will be complete''\\

 \textbf{Outputs:}\\
 ``will be complete''\\
 
\textbf{Description:} 
This function module provides the summary of the Euro radio information and the 
Verify the consistency of the contents of the Euro radio message. 
The first guaranteed by this module check is to monitor the radio link. 
This only applies to a normal communication channel (see § 8.3.1 interface gSM-R). \\

\textbf{The review is broken down as follows:}

- Basic principle: the RBC is providing its messages with a time stamp based on the 
Time marking the bi-standard the equipment (if the timestamp of the messages on 
position is undefined, the message is accepted, but only during the initialization of the 
Communication session EVC - RBC).\\

Verification of the sequence: \\

- the ETCS OBU train equipment rejects any message that is "older" than the last 
received message.\\

- the ETCS OBU train equipment is up to any message that is "younger" than the last 
received message.\\
 	 
 	 
\subsubsection{F23: Manage Eurobalise Messages}
\textbf{SRS} § 3.4, § 3.6, § 3.16\\
  
   \textbf{Inputs:}\\
``will be complete''\\

 \textbf{Outputs:}\\
 ``will be complete''\\
 
\textbf{Description:} 
This function module manages the Balise reference document of the Bi-Standard-train equipment, 
is said to know that the information supplied by the track following terms have: \\

- either the balise which provides the information, \\

- or delivered in the radio message Referenzbalise, \\

- or delivered in the infill balise message Referenzbalise (package 136). \\

A balise group contains 1-8 eurobalises. 
The balise group is referenced by an identification NIDLRBG (NIDC: identification 
+ NIDBG region: identification beacon). Each eurobalise has an internal number from 1 to 8, 
which describes the position of the beacon relaltive in the group. \\

A consisting of only one beacon balise group called "simple beacon", as 
any other balise group managed; However, it produces features that described in
Function module F23 and in the function module F25.\\

\subsubsection{F24: Manage Cnx and Dncx Euroradio}
\textbf{SRS} § 3.5, § 3.15.1, § 5.15\\

 \textbf{Inputs:}\\
``will be complete''\\

 \textbf{Outputs:}\\
 ``will be complete''\\
 
\textbf{Description:} 
This function module ensures the production ending a Euroradio- 
Communication. \\
For the ETCS OBU equipment it is possible to Euro Radio communication session
initiate: \\

- for a "start of mission": train data \\

- after one obtained from the track command: info CNX / DCNX. 
The command, an RBC to contact, the identity of the RBC and its telephone number 
(Packets 42 or 131).\\



 \subsubsection{F25: Send Euroradio Messages}
 \textbf{§ 3.4, § 3.16}\\
 
  \textbf{Inputs:}\\
``will be complete''\\

 \textbf{Outputs:}\\
 ``will be complete''\\
 
\textbf{Description:} 

This function module ensures the completeness (location and time stamp) and the 
Transmission of radio messages euro on the basis of information "radio session message", 
"Outgoing track message", "message acknowledgment" (for a radio message 136) and "CR 
Radio channel reception "(for a radio message 136 along with a package 4). \\

A radio message is sent only if between the Bi-Standard-board equipment and the 
RBC opened a euro radio session. \\

The radio messages, with the exception of the message confirmation (radio message 146) and the 
Session messages (radio message 154, 155, 156, 159) contain a "position report" package 
(O or 1 packet). \\

The structure of this "position report" package based on the following information: \\

- Info for locating the data LRBG, position, velocity, position error, moving direction,
Bi-default state for the data concerning the level and the ERTMS / ETCS mode. \\

The package 1 "special position report" is used for one or two LRBG whose 
Crossing direction is not known ((LRBG type simple balise group). \\

The package 0 "position report" is used when the direction of the LRBG is known (group 
not simple beacons, or group simple beacons, whose Balisenrichtung over by the track 
was positioned a link or package 135) (see function F23)).\\

\subsection{The openETCS Tool-Chain and its impacts on the actual model}

For understanding the modelling process and the modeling guidelines, we refer to \url{https://github.com/openETCS/modeling/blob/master/DescriptionOfWork/NewModelingDescriptionOfWork.pdf}.

To summarize the design process, the following rules are in use:
\begin{itemize}
\item Papyrus / SysML is used for modelling the architecture. Functions are visible on this SysML level.
\item No behaviour model is allowed on SysML level.
\item For referencing the requirements, links from the SysML model to the requirements document (in ProR) are being used.
\item Details and especially behaviour is part of the Scade models.
\item All interfaces (see also data-dictionary below) are available on bit-level.
\item In the architecture model in SysML, all interfaces are available on a functional level for interfaces inside and outside the model and for interfaces between dedicated functions. Due to tool constrains the current model does not show all details for all interfaces (see dataDictionary).
\end{itemize}

The openETCS tool-chain for doing the modelling work consists of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item [\textbf{Papyrus}]: for modelling the architecture (Kepler version).\\
	In this phase only the Kepler version of the tool can be used due to incompatibilities of the Kepler and the Luna version on the SysML model. The SysML models are stored in the following location: \url{https://github.com/openETCS/modeling/tree/master/model/sysml}.
	\item [\textbf{ProR}]: for keeping the requirements (REQIF).\\
	The subset 26 is converted into a REQIF-format and also stored in the modeling repository on Github. The openETCS toolchain supports the linking of SysML model parts to SRS-Requirements. These results are also part of the architecture.
	\item [\textbf{Scade}]: for designing and formalising the functions Scade version 15.2 is used.\\
	The models are stored in this location: \url{https://github.com/openETCS/modeling/tree/master/model/Scade}.
	With the component Scade System Scade also has a component for designing the architecture.
\end{itemize}

In principle, the synchronisation mechanism of Scade was planned to be used for synchronising the SysML architecture and the Scade models. The idea is to automatically synchronise the SysML types and blocks with the Scade type definitions and the Scade Operators. Unfortunately, with the current set of tools this idea cannot be realised. We will investigate other tools and models to find a solution. 

In addition, faults in the Kepler Papyrus version made it difficult for several members of the team to work on different submodels of the openETCS model. The issue will be solved when changing to the Luna version of Papyrus.

\subsection{The openETCS Tool-Chain and its impacts on the actual model}

For understanding the modelling process and the modeling guidelines, we refer to \url{https://github.com/openETCS/modeling/blob/master/DescriptionOfWork/NewModelingDescriptionOfWork.pdf}.

To summarize the design process, the following rules are in use:
\begin{itemize}
\item Papyrus / SysML is used for modelling the architecture. Functions are visible on this SysML level.
\item No behaviour model is allowed on SysML level.
\item For referencing the requirements, links from the SysML model to the requirements document (in ProR) are being used.
\item Details and especially behaviour is part of the Scade models.
\item All interfaces (see also data-dictionary below) are available on bit-level.
\item In the architecture model in SysML, all interfaces are available on a functional level for interfaces inside and outside the model and for interfaces between dedicated functions. Due to tool constrains the current model does not show all details for all interfaces (see dataDictionary).
\end{itemize}

The openETCS tool-chain for doing the modelling work consists of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item [\textbf{Papyrus}]: for modelling the architecture (Kepler version).\\
	In this phase only the Kepler version of the tool can be used due to incompatibilities of the Kepler and the Luna version on the SysML model. The SysML models are stored in the following location: \url{https://github.com/openETCS/modeling/tree/master/model/sysml}.
	\item [\textbf{ProR}]: for keeping the requirements (REQIF).\\
	The subset 26 is converted into a REQIF-format and also stored in the modeling repository on Github. The openETCS toolchain supports the linking of SysML model parts to SRS-Requirements. These results are also part of the architecture.
	\item [\textbf{Scade}]: for designing and formalising the functions Scade version 15.2 is used.\\
	The models are stored in this location: \url{https://github.com/openETCS/modeling/tree/master/model/Scade}.
	With the component Scade System Scade also has a component for designing the architecture.
\end{itemize}

In principle, the synchronisation mechanism of Scade was planned to be used for synchronising the SysML architecture and the Scade models. The idea is to automatically synchronise the SysML types and blocks with the Scade type definitions and the Scade Operators. Unfortunately, with the current set of tools this idea cannot be realised. We will investigate other tools and models to find a solution. 

In addition, faults in the Kepler Papyrus version made it difficult for several members of the team to work on different submodels of the openETCS model. The issue will be solved when changing to the Luna version of Papyrus.
