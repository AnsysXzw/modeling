Description				& Implementation of the train data with the corresponding interfaces to track, driver and RBC.\\
Data first is received from the train (TIU).
Second step: train data is sent to the driver (DMI).
The part relevant for driver interface is confirmed by the driver and sent back to the evc.
Data received via this interface is merged with the data received via TIU.\\
Message Flow:\\
Message 129 (Validated Train Data) \\
Message 8 (Acknowledment of Train Data) is processed as apart of the validation procedure with the RBC.\\
Message 146 (Acknolwedement)\\
Messages from RBC: \\
Message 8 (Acknowledment) is processed as apart of the validation procedure with the RBC.\\

API requirements 		& Train Data needs systemtime for stamping messages, access to input from the track messages and access to the output of RBC messages\\

\subsection{Interface}

An overview of the interface of component trainData is shown in Figure~\ref{f:traindata_interface}. The inputs and outputs are described in detail in Section~\ref{s:traindata_inputs} respectively \ref{s:traindata_outputs}. Sub components are described in Section~\ref{s:traindata_subcomponents}.
