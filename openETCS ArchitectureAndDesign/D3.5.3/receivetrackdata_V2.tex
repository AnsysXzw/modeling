Description				& The block ``Manage\_TrackSideInformation\_Integration'' is responsible for receiving Eurobalise telegrams and Euroradio messages from the API and performs several consistency checks on the inputs.\newline

The block collects the telegrams of balises in order to build balise group messages. Euroradio messages are always delivered as a whole message. On each message, a consistency check is performed, before the data is validated according to the driving direction of the train. In general, messages not designated for the current driving direction of the train are not forwarded to the further processing. After applying consistency checks, the data direction is validated. \\
\midrule
Input documents	& 
See sub-components.\\
\midrule
Safety integrity level		& 4 \\
\midrule
Time constraints		& The component has to be able to receive balise telegrams and radio messages according to the ETCS \cite{subset-41} performance requirements). In highspeed traffic, a group of 8 balises must be read in about 250 msec. In addition, 1 message per sec. on the radio interface is to be expected.\\
\midrule
API requirements 		& Interfaces to this unit are defined in the API sections [BTM], [EURORADIO], [ODO].In these sections, also a detailed definition of the concepts implemented on those interfaces is documented.  \\
