Description				& Detects, when the range of a linked BG (where it is expected to be found) is left and the BG has not been passed yet. Steadily observes the current train position and detects, when the train leaves the expectation window of any BG. When this happens, checks wether it is a linked BG and has been marked as passed. If not, it was not found within its expectation window.  \\
