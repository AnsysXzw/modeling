Description				& This operator is the counterpart to operator SDM\_OutputWrapper---that is, it converts all internal outputs of SDM that contain information about length, speed, distance, and acceleration defined as real into int, such that all other blocks can stick to their types and also performs the calculation into units used by the environment.

This operator forwards input messages and transforms inputs messages into an internal type thereby converting real to int.\\
