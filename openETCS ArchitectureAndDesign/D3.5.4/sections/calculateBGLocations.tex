Description				& Calculates the location of a just overpassed balise group related to the list of all so far known balise groups. If the just overpassed balise group has been announced via linking (packet 5) previously, it's location is adjusted to the best-of combination of linking and odometry information. If the just overpassed BG is a linked balise group, the locations of all known balise groups ahead and astern are recalculated with the just overpassed balise group as the one with minimized location uncertainties.  

If the overpassed balise group announces balise groups ahead via linking (packet 5), these balise groups are added to the list of known balise groups.
