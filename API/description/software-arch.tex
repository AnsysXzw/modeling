The \emph{reference abstract software architecture} is shown in figure
\ref{fig:software-arch}. This architecture is made of following
elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{openETCS executable model} produced by the
  \cite{scade-model}. It shall contain the program implementing core
  ETCS functions;
\item \emph{openETCS model run-time system} shall help the execution
  of the openETCS executable model by providing additional functions
  like encode/decode messages, proper execution of the model through
  appropriate scheduling, re-order or prioritize messages, etc. This
  block shall be described in another openETCS document. \FIXME{ref?}
\item \emph{Vendor specific API adapter} shall make the link between
  the Vendor specific platform and the openETCS model run-time system.
  It can buffer message parts, encode/decode messages, route messages
  to other EVC components, etc.
\item All above three elements shall be included in the EVC;
\item \emph{Vendor specific platform} shall be all other elements of
  the system, bus and other units, as shown in figure
  \ref{fig:hardware-arch}.
\end{itemize}

We have thus three interfaces:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{model interface} is the interface between openETCS
  executable model and openETCS model run-time system. It shall be
  described in another openETCS document \FIXME{ref?};
\item \emph{openETCS API} is the interface between openETCS model
  run-time system and Vendor specific API adapter. It is described in
  this document;
\item \emph{Vendor specific API} is the interface between Vendor
  specific API adapter and Vendor specific platform. This interface is
  not publicly described.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Information exchange between blocks}
At this level of description, we do not explain how the various blocks
of above architecture are calling themselves. We only assume they are
exchanging \emph{messages} in an asynchronous way. A message is a set
of information corresponding to an event of a particular unit, e.g. a
balise received from the BTM. The possible kind of messages are
described in chapter \ref{information-flows}.

How the exchange of messages in implemented in actual software,
e.g. function call, storage of data in a shared buffer, ..., is
described in chapter \ref{concrete-interface}.

\paragraph{Architectural variations}
Please note that the reference abstract hardware and software
architectures do not forbid architectural variations. For example, the
Odometry function could be put within the EVC (see figure
\ref{fig:software-arch}) instead of a separate hardware unit (as it
was shown on figure \ref{fig:hardware-arch}). But communication
between this Odometry function within EVC and the openETCS model
run-time system should be done through the openETCS API and follow its
conventions.
