\subsubsection{Receive Eurobalise From API}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Short Description of Functionality}\\
This function defines the interface of the OBU model to the openETCS generic API for Eurobalise Messages. On the interface, either a valid telegram is provided or a telegram is indicated which could not be received correct when passing the balise. The function passes the telegram without major changes of the information to the next entity for collecting the balise group information.

%\item \textbf{{Reference to the SRS (or other requirements}\\
\item \textbf{Design Constrains and Choices}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Decoding of balises is done at the API. Also, packets received via the interface are already transformed into a usable shape.
\item Only packets used inside the current model are passed via the interface:\\
	Packet 5: Linking Information.\\
	Linking Information is filled into the linking array starting from index 0 without gaps. Used elements are marked as valid. Elements are sorted according to the order given by the telegram sequence.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Build BG Group}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Short Description of Functionality}\\
This entity collects telegrams received via the interface into Balise Group Information.
\item \textbf{Reference to the SRS (or other requirements}\\
\item \textbf{Design Constrains and Choices}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Telegrams received as invalid are passed to the ``Check-Function'' in order to process errors in communication with the trackside according to the requirements and in a single place.
Telegrams are filled into the telegram array starting from index 0 without gaps. Used elements are marked as valid. Elements are stored according to the order given by the telegram sequence. 
\item Only packets used inside the current model are passed via the interface:\\
	Packet 5: Linking Information.\\
\item In this function packets past with the telegrams is accumulated into a balise group information.\\
\item Further assumption on packet 5 (based on SRS subset 26, section 8.4.1.4)\\
(In this statement the term ``message'' is ambiguous since it can reflect to a telegram or a balise group message)
	Linking Information can only be passed once. This means, if linking information for the balise group is already collected with one of the earlier telegrams, the information will not be accumulated but overwritten.\\
\end{enumerate}
