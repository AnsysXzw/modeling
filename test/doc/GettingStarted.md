## Getting Started: Batch Tests

This is a short introduction on how to execute the SCADE test scenarios provided in [test/src](test/src/).
There are two modes of operation:
* Batch execution using the command line tool `stest`; this option also supports test report generation.
* Interactive simulation in SCADE.

### Batch Mode (command line)

### Interactive Mode (SCADE UI)
