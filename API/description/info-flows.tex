\chapter{Abstract information flows}
\label{information-flows}

We describe in this chapter the information flow betwen EVC and other
units using ASN.1 notation. See appendix \ref{asn1-primer} to know
more about ASN.1.

\section{Train Interface}

The interface between the EVC and Train Interface Unit is defined in
following \ASN{Train-interface} module. This module defines
\ASN{Message-Train-Interface-to-EVC} and
\ASN{Message-EVC-to-Train-Interface}.

Its structure follows \cite{subset-094} which itself defines a
concrete interface for \cite{subset-034} (Train Interface FIS).
