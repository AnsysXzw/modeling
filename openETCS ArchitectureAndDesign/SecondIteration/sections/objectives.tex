\subsubsection{Functional Scope: The Minimum OBU Kernel Function}
\label{sec:FunctionalScopeTheMinimumOBUKernelFunction}

The objective ``Make the train run with a very minimum functionality'' shall be in terms of ETCS OBU translated into 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Train moves on a track equipped with balises and determines its position.
\end{itemize}
That means, for this very first step, the train shall not supervise the maximum speed nor activate the brakes. Instead, the minimum function set shall be limited to (see \url{https://github.com/openETCS/SRS-Analysis/issues/9} ) 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Receive, filter and manage balise information received from track (see \url{https://github.com/openETCS/SRS-Analysis/issues/12})
	\item Calculate the actual train position based on balise and odometry information (see \url{https://github.com/openETCS/SRS-Analysis/issues/8})
	\item Calculate the distances between the actual train position to track elements in its front
\end{itemize}
A more detailed architectural breakdown of these functions is available as a SysML model at (see \url{https://github.com/openETCS/modeling/tree/master/model/sysml}. 

In addition, the work on this minimum functionality requires to be supported by
\begin{itemize}
	\item The availability of the ETCS language as specified in Subset UNISIG Subset\_026, chapters 7 and 8
	\item The abiltiy to link intermediate and final results with the requirements of the ETCS specification (subset\_026, \dots) 
	\item The usability of a data dictionary (see \url{https://github.com/openETCS/dataDictionary} )
\end{itemize}
These supporting prerequisites are under construction and therefore not completely operable actually. How to deal with these restrictions, will be outlined in chapter ???

\subsubsection{Actual Status}
\label{sec:ActualStatus}

Some first analysis steps for the required minimum functionality have been performed as results from the SRS-Analysis task force. These results are available at \url{https://github.com/openETCS/SRS-Analysis}.


\subsubsection{Practical Approach}
\label{sec:PracticalApproach}

The architecture and design of the minimum OBU kernel shall be developed in consideration of the actual status, restricted prerequisites and limited resources as follows.
