Description				& The motivation for this operator is to convert all inputs of SDM that contain information about length, speed, distance, and acceleration defined as integer into \texttt{real} to allow automatically the highest precision in the calculations by the meaning of floating point operations. In addition, to ease the modeling, inside block ``Speed Supervision'' only units meters ($[m]$), seconds($[s]$), meters per second($[\frac{m}{s}]$), and meters per square second($[\frac{m}{s^{2}}]$) are used.

This operator forwards input messages, takes data from complex data types or transforms inputs messages into an internal type thereby converting int to real. \\
