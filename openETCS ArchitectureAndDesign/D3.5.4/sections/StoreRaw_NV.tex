Description				& Receives National Values from the track. Stores them "as-is" onboard. If Subset\_026 chapter 6 is applicable, baseline 3 conformal information is calculated based on packet 3 and packet 203 (according to older versions). Missing trackside information is complemented throug default onboard values. \\

Input documents	& 
Subset-026, Chapter 6
Subset-026, Chapter 7
Subset-026, Chapter 8\\
\midrule
Safety integrity level	& 4 \\
\midrule
Time constraints		& n/a \\
\midrule
API requirements 		& Based on data formats and functions defined by TrackMessages package\\
