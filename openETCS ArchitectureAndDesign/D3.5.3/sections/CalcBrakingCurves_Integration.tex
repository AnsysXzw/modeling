Description				& For each type of target a certain braking curve has to be calculated. This curve enables proactive monitoring of the train's speed. A reverse lookup on this braking curve indicates, where the train has to start braking given the current speed. The braking curve does not depend on the actual train status. As a consequence the braking curve stays constant over time. As a legitimate simplification the calculation of the braking curve is not extended past the estimated front end position of the train. \\
