The system architecture of the openETCS OBU is adopted from the system structure defined in ERA Subset-026, Chapter 2.5 \cite{subset-026}. Figure \ref{f:architecture_srs} shows which parts of the reference architecture are in the scope of the openETCS OBU model, cf.~dashed red line. Note that also specific parts of the ETCS trackside (e.g.~Eurobalise and RBC blocks) have been modeled to have an integrated test environment, cf.~dashed black line in Figure~\ref{f:architecture_srs}.

\section{Top Level Architecture and External Interfaces}

Figure~\ref{f:top_level} shows the top level architecture with external interfaces E1, E2,$\ldots$, E9. The external interfaces are used for the communication between the openETCS OBU (dashed red line) and systems out of the scope of the openETCS project and the ETCS Onboard Unit System. In the following we give  brief overview of the interfaces:

\todo[inline]{Descriptions should be improved}
\begin{description}
\item[E1:] In- and out flow between the Interlocking and the Eurobalise. Only relevant for controlled Eurobalises.

\item[E2:] In- and out-flow between the Interlocking and Radio Block Center.

\item[E3:] Input flow from the Eurobalise to the ERTMS Track module.

\item[E4:] Input flow from the RBC to the ERTMS Track module.

\item[E5:] This interface is used for the interaction between the driver and the display (Driver Machine Interface, DMI).

\item[E6:] This interface is a compound structure and combines the interfaces E3 and E4 to send track side messages from Eurobalises or RBC to the ETCS OBU.

\item[E7:] In- and out-flow between RBC and ETCS OBU. This interface is used for the management of radio communication, e.g.~session management, and sending radio messages from the ETCS OBU to the RBC. Note that the ETCS OBU receives radio messages via interface E6.

\item[E8:] Input interface to the odometry subsystem of the ETCS OBU. Used for sending information to the train if there is any movement outside the ETCS System, e.g.~"cold movement".

\item[E9:] Input interface to the ETCS OBU to set configuration data such as fixed values, system values, national values and train configuration.

\item[E10:] In- and Out flow between the ETCS OBU and the train. This interface is used for the interaction between the train and the ETCS OBU such as brake control, traction control, door control, etc.

\section{Functional breakdown of the ETCS OBU}

Figure \ref{f:ETCS_OBU_decomposition} depicts the functional breakdown of the ETCS OBU block shown in Figure~\ref{f:top_level}.\todo[fancyline]{Figure is incomplete and erroneous...

\begin{description}
\item[I1:] In flow from the Balise Transmission Module (BTM or Antenna) to the "F2 ETCS Kernel" trough Runtime API in. Transmitted data are information from the Eurobalise.

\item[I2:] In flow from the Odometrie (ODO) to the "F2 ETCS Kernel" trough Runtime API in. Transmitted data are information from the movement of the train.

\item[I3:] In- and Out flow between the DMI Controller and the "F2 ETCS Kernel" trough Runtime API in and out. Transmitted data are information of driver action and display. See description in figure of "External Interface E5".

\item[I4:] Out flow from "F2 ETCS Kernel" to the JRU manager trough Runtime API out. Transmitted data are all necessary information for a juridical recorder unit "black box".

\item[I5:] In- and Out flow between the Euroradio and "F2 ETCS Kernel" trough Runtime API in and out. Transmitted data are radio track information (RBC) and information to the track (RBC).
