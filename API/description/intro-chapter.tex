\chapter{Introduction and context}

\section{Introduction}

This document describes the ``openETCS API''. The openETCS API is an
open, standardized, interface between a vendor specific platform and
the openETCS application software. More details on the software
architecture are given in chapter \ref{software-arch}.

\paragraph{Main objectives} The main objectives of this document are
to describe an API:
\begin{itemize}
\item Suitable for every partner of openETCS project;
\item Compatible with Vendor specific API through an ``Adaptation Layer'';
\item Making explicit all assumptions, including non-functional ones;
\item Language agnostic, allowing interfacing with software written
  in C, Ada or other programming languages;
\item Simple;
\item Fulfilling safety objectives;
\item Offering reasonable performance.
\end{itemize}
