\todo[inline]{to be checked}
The management of radio communication MoRC implements the onboard management part of a single communication session with the track, i.e. a single RBC. It controls the establishing, maintaining and termination process of a radio communication session and steers the underlying communication safety layer and the mobile device. Those and the data transfer itself are not part of the function. 

The kernel function of the MoRC component is \emph{managementOfRadioCommunication} (figure ???). The implementation is kept close to the prose of Subset-026, chap. 3.5. Since chap. 3.5 rarely refers to terms, variable types, packets and messages of the ETCS language as specified in Subset-026, chap. 7 and 8, \emph{managementOfRadioCommunication} does neither. 

To be capable of being integrated with other OBU software components, \emph{MoRC} had to be wrapped with a transformer between the ETCS and the "chap. 3.5" language. This is the purpose of the main function of \emph{MoRC}, \emph{MoRC\_Main}.  \\

\subsection{Interface}

An overview of the interface of component Manage\_Radio\_Communication is shown in Figure~\ref{f:manage_radio_communication_interface}. The inputs and outputs are described in detail in Section~\ref{s:manage_radio_communication_inputs} respectively \ref{s:manage_radio_communication_outputs}. Sub components are described in Section~\ref{s:manage_radio_communication_subcomponents}.
