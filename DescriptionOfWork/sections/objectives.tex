\subsection{Functional Scope: The Minimum OBU Kernel Function}
\label{sec:FunctionalScopeTheMinimumOBUKernelFunction}

The objective “Make the train run with a very minimum functionality” shall be in terms of on ETCS OBU translated into 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Train moves on a track equipped with balises and determines its position.
\end{itemize}

That means, for this very first step the train shall not supervise the maximum speed, shall not activate the brakes. Instead, the minimum function set shall be limited to (see \href{https://github.com/openETCS/SRS-Analysis/issues/9} ) 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Receive, filter and manage balise information, received from track (see \href{https://github.com/openETCS/SRS-Analysis/issues/12})
	\item Calculate the actual train position based on balise and odometry information (see \href{https://github.com/openETCS/SRS-Analysis/issues/8})
	\item Calculate the distances between the actual train position to track elements in its front
\end{itemize}

A more detailed architectural breakdown of these functions is available in the form of a SysML model at (see \href{https://github.com/openETCS/modeling/tree/master/model/sysml}. 

In addition, the work on this minimum functionality requires to be supported by
\begin{itemize}
	\item The availability of the ETCS language as specified in Subset UNISIG Subset\_026, chapter 7 and 8
	\item The abiltiy to link intermediate and final results with the requirements of the ETCS specification (subset\_026, ..) 
	\item The usability of a data dictionary (see \href{https://github.com/openETCS/dataDictionary} )
\end{itemize}

These supporting prerequisites are under construction and therefore not completely operable actually. How to deal with these restrictions, will be outlined in chapter ???

\subsection{Actual Status}
\label{sec:ActualStatus}

Some first analyis steps for the required minimum functionality have been gone as results from the SRS-Analysis task force. These results are available on \href{https://github.com/openETCS/SRS-Analysis}


\subsection{Practical Approach}
\label{sec:PracticalApproach}

The architecture and design of the minimum OBU kernel shall be developed in consideration of the actual status, restricted prerequisites and limited resources as follows.
