Description				& This operator implements the braking models. At this stage only the lamda trains (conversion) model is implemented. The output of the conversion model are a location independent, but highly National Values dependent, braking curves. One for the service brake and one for the emergency brake. As a side product, the model related brake build-up times are also generated.\\
