Description				& This component describes the Start of Mission procedure of the train until the status of the awakeness. From this point of the awakness the train will be able to start different modes, levels and further procedure. See scope of the Start of Mission - Awakness of train in the figure below.

For the third iteration just a part of the Scope has been design. To complete the scenario in the third iteration the ideal path to the awakness of train until the state "waiting for Driver selection of "Start"" have been realized. Furthermore the initial data from the persistend database such as Level, Driver ID, Train Number, Train Data, Radio Number, RBC ID hase been consider as constants. \\
