Description				& This functionality describes the Start of Mission procedure of the train in Level 2 or 3 and the Modes SR FS OS LS SH where the train under the defined Mode Level supervision starts running.

For the this iteration just a part of the Scope has been design. To complete the scenario in the third iteration the path "Full Supervision Movement Authority received from RBC" has been realized. The state will end after the train receives the Change Authority to FS and will be ready to run.\\
