This document gives an introduction to the architecture of the first openETCS iteration, the openETCS kernel functions. It has to be read as an add-on to the models in SysML, Scade and to additional reading referenced from the document.

\section{The openETCS Architecture of the initial kernel functions}

\subsection{The openETCS Tool-Chain and its impacts on the actual model}

For understanding the modelling process and the modeling guidelines, we refer to \url{https://github.com/openETCS/modeling/blob/master/DescriptionOfWork/NewModelingDescriptionOfWork.pdf}.

To summarize the design process, the following rules are in use:
\begin{itemize}
\item Papyrus / SysML is used for modelling the architecture. Functions are visible on this SysML level.
\item No behaviour model is allowed on SysML level.
\item For referencing the requirements, links from the SysML model to the requirements document (in ProR) are being used.
\item Details and especially behaviour is part of the Scade models.
\item All interfaces (see also data-dictionary below) are available on bit-level.
\item In the architecture model in SysML, all interfaces are available on a functional level for interfaces inside and outside the model and for interfaces between dedicated functions. Due to tool constrains the current model does not show all details for all interfaces (see dataDictionary).
\end{itemize}

The openETCS tool-chain for doing the modelling work consists of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item [\textbf{Papyrus}]: for modelling the architecture (Kepler version).\\
	In this phase only the Kepler version of the tool can be used due to incompatibilities of the Kepler and the Luna version on the SysML model. The SysML models are stored in the following location: \url{https://github.com/openETCS/modeling/tree/master/model/sysml}.
	\item [\textbf{ProR}]: for keeping the requirements (REQIF).\\
	The subset 26 is converted into a REQIF-format and also stored in the modeling repository on Github. The openETCS toolchain supports the linking of SysML model parts to SRS-Requirements. These results are also part of the architecture.
	\item [\textbf{Scade}]: for designing and formalising the functions Scade version 15.2 is used.\\
	The models are stored in this location: \url{https://github.com/openETCS/modeling/tree/master/model/Scade}.
	With the component Scade System Scade also has a component for designing the architecture.
\end{itemize}

In principle, the synchronisation mechanism of Scade was planned to be used for synchronising the SysML architecture and the Scade models. The idea is to automatically synchronise the SysML types and blocks with the Scade type definitions and the Scade Operators. Unfortunately, with the current set of tools this idea cannot be realised. We will investigate other tools and models to find a solution. 

In addition, faults in the Kepler Papyrus version made it difficult for several members of the team to work on different submodels of the openETCS model. The issue will be solved when changing to the Luna version of Papyrus.
